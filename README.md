## Introduction

In today's fast-paced tech environment, the ability to translate code between languages is crucial. **CodeSynapse** investigates how various LLMs handle this task. By comparing models like GPT-4, LLaMA3, and Phi2, we aim to identify strengths and weaknesses in code translation.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in the field of code translation and LLMs.

## Features

- Comparative analysis of different LLMs for code translation.
- Benchmarks for performance evaluation.
- User-friendly interface for testing translations.
- Support for multiple programming languages including Python, Go, and ReactJS.
- Docker support for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used

**CodeSynapse** utilizes a range of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Go, JavaScript (ReactJS)
- **Models**: GPT-4, LLaMA3, Phi2
- **Tools**: DeepSeek Coder, Docker
- **Topics**: code-translation, deepseek-coder, llms

## Getting Started

To get started with **CodeSynapse**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dekunited/CodeSynapse.git
   cd CodeSynapse
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use Docker to manage dependencies. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After setting up, you can start the application using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run app
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the web interface to test code translations. Input your code in the provided field and select the source and target languages. The application will display the translated code, allowing you to analyze the results.

### Example

1. Input your code snippet in Python.
2. Select the target language (e.g., Go).
3. Click on "Translate" to see the output.
